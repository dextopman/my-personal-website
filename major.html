                <p>This was my BTech final year project in which me and my teammates have developed a face monitoring and alert system in which it can identify whether the person is wearing mask
                or not and whether he/she has maintained social distancing.</p>

            <h3>University-Recommendation-System</h3>
            <p>I have built an interactive webapp using python Streamlit library, where students can find their favorite universities based on their choice and will also get recommended other similar 20 higher institutes/universities based on their rankings and scores. </p>
