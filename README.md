# my-personal-website
Just building my own website.

For Frontend, I have used HTML, CSS & Javascript for building my website.

For Backend, I have used NodeJs to connect the backend API with my webpage. I have used REST 
API to perform CRUD operations.

For the database, I have NPM package manager sqlite3 for the creating and connecting database with API server. 

Finally, I registered my website and hosted using GoDaddy.

You can now visit my [website](https://digantasonowal.in)
